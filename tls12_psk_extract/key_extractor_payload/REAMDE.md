# WhatsApp key extractor payload

To build this payload, edit **Makefile.config** and set appropriate values to
the various build variables.

Alternatively you can export environment variables named after the build options
in order to override **Makefile.config**.

When ready, run `make`.

Use **stub/payload.zip** as discussed in our blog post.
